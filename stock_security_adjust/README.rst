This module makes adjustments to security settings of stock-related
functions.

-  Adds 'Inventory / Officer' group in between 'Inventory / User' and
   'Inventory / Manager'.
-  Gives 'Inventory / Officer' access to the *Inventory > Reporting*
   menu node.
-  Makes some fields and buttons of Inventory Adjustments list view
   invisible, as well as hiding the menu item for users without
   Inventory/Administrator group.
